Biomio Core Algorithms Module

Core Packages Tree:
- algorithms - various algorithms for image and data processing.
	- images - various image processing algorithms (SQI, HSV-RGB and RGB-HSV conversation, GaborFilter etc.).
	- clustering - data clustering algorithms (FOREL, kmeans).
	- hashing - modules for data hashing and ANN search based on external/xnearpy.
	- cascades - implementation of detection algorithms for face detection and rotation detection based on Haar Cascades. 
	- cvtools - simple useful algorithms based on OpenCV.
	- features - implementation of features detector and extractors (BRISK, ORB, SURF, Mahotas SURF).
- analytics - classes for data and statistics collecting.
- external - modules and frameworks, which extend possibilities of external modules and frameworks.
	- xopenface - extended OpenFace (Link: https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/ ).
	- xnearpy - extended NearPy. Note: Can be implemented as independent Python Package as we rewrite most classes of original NearPy (Link: http://pixelogik.github.io/NearPy/ ).
- flows - complex image and data processing algorithms based on Flows Architecture.
	- openface - OpenFace Verification algorithms based on Flows Architecture.
- processes - complex image and data processing algorithms based on Process Architecture (architecture of Keypoints Face Verification Plugin).
	- recognition - algorithms for face verification and identification based on Process Architecture.
- requirements.txt - separated requirements file for algorithms.
